# Multi search picture words for Chinese students.

## What is the best tools to learn English?

1. Anki, Space repetition System.
2. Forgo, pronunciation of native speaker.
3. Youdao, get most frequently used sentence of this word.

## What is this workflow used for?

I’m a Non-native English speaker, using flash cards to learn English words. 

[*Fluent Forever*](https://fluent-forever.com/multi-search/#.VbbM7XhhNo4) this book suggests: 

1. Search Google image to know ‘what does this word mean’.
2. Search Forgo to get pronunciation of native speaker
3. Search Youdao dictionary to learn the explanation of this word.

So I am wondering, is there a convenient way to search all the resource in one shoot.

That’s the reason why I build this Alfred workflow.


## How to use it?

1. Install Alfred

2. double click `Multisearch.alfredworkflow` to import this workflow.
